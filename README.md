#Java File Mover App
Java GUI application to drag and drop a file and specify a folder name for it to be moved to.
This was built with a file organization structured with folders and subfolders further specifying the sub-topics or sub-categories for files to
reside in.
For example:
Documents\
&emsp;  Personal\
&emsp;&emsp;    Insurance\
&emsp;&emsp;    Leasing Agreements\
&emsp;  School\
&emsp;&emsp;    UT_Fall_2016\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      ARC_308\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      CS_314\
&emsp;&emsp;    UT_Spr_2017\
&emsp;&emsp;      ...\
      
It definitely helps to have a unique naming structure to use this app. Future improvements to consider would be the full capability to handle partial names
and a folder creation function with templates. I mainly used this during college as I organized my classwork, so its main function was sufficient for me as
I will not be updating this. Fun side project otherwise outside of class that helped facilitate double click all of my subdirectories just to drag and drop
a file.
